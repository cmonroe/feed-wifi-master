Subject: [PATCH] hostapd: mtk: Fix unexpected AP beacon state transition

When AP fails to set the beacon, it assigns bss->beacon_set to 0 no
matter what the error number is.
However, in the case that the error number is -EBUSY, the driver might
not free the beacon and expect a later beacon re-setting. If hostapd set
a new beacon under this case, the driver will return -EALREADY.
This patch checks the error number after hostapd fails to set the
beacon. If the error number is -EBUSY, bss->beacon_set will not be
assigned to 0.
